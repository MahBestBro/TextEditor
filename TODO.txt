There's no strict order but generally speaking the closer to the top the more important

FEATURES: 
    - Undo stack
    - Smooth transitioning offcreen text
    - Load and save file

    - The rest of the default commands (do some research)
    - Mutiple tabs
    - Have brackets and quotes come in pairs
    - Multiline cursor
    - User settings/customisation for text colour and maybe inputs if not too tedious
    - UI?

PROGRAMMING/REFACTORING:
    - Have a function that can map a callback function to an input
        - Pass in inputcode and function poitner, then creates a timed event mapped to input 
          code.
    - Refactor timed events, make them neater and more flexibe if possible?
