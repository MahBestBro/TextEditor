There's no strict order but generally speaking the closer to the top the more important

FEATURES: 
    - Wrap Text
    - Find and Replace
    - The rest of the default commands (do some research)
    - Mutiple editors
    - Multiline cursor
    - Customisation for syntax highlighting and inputs if not too tedious
    - UI?
    - Terminal?

LIST OF COMMANDS TO IMPLEMENT:
    - Ctrl+F: Find
    - Ctrl+J: Jump to Line
    - Ctrl+Q: Close editor
    - Ctrl+T: Opens terminal (unlikely but would be cool)
    -
    - Ctrl+Shift+C: Opens command prompt
    - Ctrl+Shift+F: Highlights all instances of word in file (do we want to do this?)
    - Ctrl+Shift+N: Opens New Window (do we want this?)
    - Ctrl+Shift+Q: Closes Window

PROGRAMMING/REFACTORING:
    - Refactor Undo System, especially the string stuff
    - Idea for syntax highlighting customisation
        - have this mainly be coded and compiled by user and give helper functions 
          (create demo one though) 
    - Improve performance of either the syntax highlighter or the drawing function
    - Consider removing editor moving side effects from functions?
    - Have a function that can map a callback function to an input
        - Pass in inputcode and function pointer which'll be mapped to input.
        - Add optional repeat option which adds timed event.
        - Have multiple callbacks be allowed to be bound to an input
    - Separate adding a single character and "paired" characters (e.g., (), {}, "", etc.)
    - Refactor timed events, make them neater and more flexibe if possible?
