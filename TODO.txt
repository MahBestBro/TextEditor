There's no strict order but generally speaking the closer to the top the more important

FEATURES: 
    - Brighten up current line?
    - Wrap Text
    - Find and Replace
    - The rest of the default commands (do some research)
    - Mutiple tabs
    - Multiline cursor
    - Customisation for syntax highlighting and inputs if not too tedious
    - UI?
    - Terminal?

LIST OF COMMANDS TO IMPLEMENT:
    - Ctrl+F: Find
    - Ctrl+J: Jump to Line
    - Ctrl+N: Creates new text file
    - Ctrl+Q: Close tab
    - Ctrl+T: Opens terminal (unlikely but would be cool)
    - Ctrl++: Zoom in
    - Ctrl+-: Zoom out
    -
    - Ctrl+Shift+C: Opens command prompt
    - Ctrl+Shift+F: Highlights all instances of word in file (do we want to do this?)
    - Ctrl+Shift+N: Opens New Window (do we want this?)
    - Ctrl+Shift+Q: Closes Window

PROGRAMMING/REFACTORING:
    - Idea for syntax highlighting customisation
        - have tokenisers be something user compiles (give demo one though)
        - have bindings for strings and chars to colours
    - Have tokeniser only produce tokens for what's on screen 
    - Consider removing editor moving side effects from functions?
    - Consider moving away from c-string (i.e., make string lib or find good string lib)
    - Start using custom and local allocators instead of malloc all the time
        - Have a local allocator for temporary strings that just flushes every frame
    - Have a function that can map a callback function to an input
        - Pass in inputcode and function pointer which'll be mapped to input.
        - Add optional repeat option which adds timed event.
    - Refactor timed events, make them neater and more flexibe if possible?

BUG FIXES:
    - Fix bug where mouse input that happens outside of window does not get updated
