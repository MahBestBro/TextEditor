This is in order of when to do them, so try to do whatever the first point is.

FEATURES:
    - Have lines positioned properly on screen 
    - Cursor highlighting
    - Commands (e.g., ctrl + c, ctrl + v. Some of these are reliant on cursor highlighting)
    - Smooth Offscreen text
    - Syntax highlighting
    - Load and save file
    - Have brackets and quotes come in pairs
    - User settings/customisation for text colour and maybe inputs if not too tedious
    - UI?

PROGRAMMING/REFACTORING:
    - Set advances to pixels instead of 64th pixels
    - Refactor timed events, make them neater and more flexibe if possible?
