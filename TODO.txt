This is in order of when to do them, so try to do whatever the first point is.

FEATURES: 
    - Be able to delete/replace whatever text is highlighted
    - Have lines positioned properly on screen 
    - Commands (e.g., ctrl + c, ctrl + v. Some of these are reliant on cursor highlighting)
    - Smooth Offscreen text
    - Syntax highlighting
    - Load and save file
    - Have brackets and quotes come in pairs
    - User settings/customisation for text colour and maybe inputs if not too tedious
    - UI?

PROGRAMMING/REFACTORING:
    - Have a function that can map a callback function to an input
        - Pass in inputcode and function poitner, then creates a timed event mapped to input 
          code.
    - Refactor timed events, make them neater and more flexibe if possible?
