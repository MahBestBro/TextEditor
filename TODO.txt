There's no strict order but generally speaking the closer to the top the more important

FEATURES: 
    - Have lines positioned properly on screen 
    - Commands (e.g., ctrl + c, ctrl + v. Some of these are reliant on cursor highlighting)
    - Smooth Offscreen text
    - Syntax highlighting
    - Load and save file
    - Have brackets and quotes come in pairs
    - Multiline cursor
    - User settings/customisation for text colour and maybe inputs if not too tedious
    - UI?

PROGRAMMING/REFACTORING:
    - Refactor all the highlighting stuff - clean repetition where possible
    - Have a function that can map a callback function to an input
        - Pass in inputcode and function poitner, then creates a timed event mapped to input 
          code.
    - Refactor timed events, make them neater and more flexibe if possible?
