PROGRAMMING/REFACTORING:
    - Consider removing editor moving side effects from functions?
    - Consider moving away from c-string (i.e., make string lib or find good string lib)
    - Have a function that can map a callback function to an input
        - Pass in inputcode and function pointer which'll be mapped to input.
        - Add optional repeat option which adds timed event.
    - Refactor timed events, make them neater and more flexibe if possible?
