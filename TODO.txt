There's no strict order but generally speaking the closer to the top the more important

PROGRAMMING/REFACTORING:
    - Make a "win32Free" function so I don't have to include windows.h and screw function names over
    - Consider removing editor moving side effects from functions?
    - Consider moving away from c-string (i.e., make string lib or find good string lib)
    - Figure out that HH way of including files, speeds up build times
    - Have a function that can map a callback function to an input
        - Pass in inputcode and function poitner, then creates a timed event mapped to input 
          code.
    - Refactor timed events, make them neater and more flexibe if possible?
